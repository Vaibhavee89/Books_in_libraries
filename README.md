# Book Clustering with KMeans

## Project Overview

This project focuses on clustering books using the KMeans algorithm. It utilizes a dataset of books with various attributes such as `Name`, `Rating`, `PagesNumber`, `PublishYear`, `Authors`, and more. The main goal is to classify books into different clusters (or shelves) based on these features.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `Id`: Unique identifier for each book.
- `Name`: Title of the book.
- `RatingDist1`, `RatingDist2`, `RatingDist3`, `RatingDist4`, `RatingDist5`: Distribution of ratings given by users.
- `PagesNumber`: The number of pages in the book.
- `PublishYear`: The year the book was published.
- `Language`: The language in which the book is written.
- `Authors`: The author(s) of the book.
- `Rating`: Average rating of the book.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading

The dataset is read from a CSV file using pandas.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

data = pd.read_csv('book.csv')
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
k = pd.DataFrame(data)
l = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

### 2. Data Preview

Preview of the dataset:
```
Id    Name                                              RatingDist1  PagesNumber  RatingDist4  PublishYear  Language  Authors       Rating  RatingDist2  RatingDist5  RatingDist3
0     Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ...         6.913888889  652         4:556485     2006         eng       J.K. Rowling  4.57    2:25317      5:1546466    3:159960
1     Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix...       1:12455      870         4:604283     2004         eng       J.K. Rowling  4.5     2:37005      5:1493113    3:211781
...
```

### 3. Data Encoding

Non-numeric columns like `Name`, `Authors`, and `Language` are encoded using `LabelEncoder` to make them suitable for machine learning models.

```python
lb = LabelEncoder()
for x in df:
    if df[x].dtype == 'object':
        df[x] = lb.fit_transform(df[x])
```

### 4. Data Standardization

The dataset is standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features are on the same scale before clustering.

```python
sc = StandardScaler()
df = sc.fit_transform(df)
df = pd.DataFrame(df, columns=k.columns)
```

### 5. KMeans Clustering

We apply the KMeans algorithm to cluster the books into 10 groups (or shelves).

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10, random_state=0)
kmeans.fit(df)
```

### 6. Label Assignment

The clustering labels are assigned back to the original dataset under a new column `Shelf`.

```python
labe = kmeans.labels_
lastdf = pd.DataFrame(data)
for x in range(len(lastdf)):
    lastdf.loc[x, 'Shelf'] = labe[x]
```

### 7. Resulting Dataset

The final dataset includes the new `Shelf` column, which indicates the cluster to which each book belongs.

```
Shelf   Id    Name    RatingDist1  PagesNumber  RatingDist4  PublishYear  Language  Authors  Rating  RatingDist2  RatingDist5  RatingDist3
0       0     18896   2370         1955         7031         401         362       11252   385     2863         5617         4631
1       1     8131    18899        1633         2633         7111        399       362      11252   378     2939         5552         4991
...
```

## Dependencies

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Running the Project

1. Load the dataset into a Jupyter notebook or script.
2. Run the provided code to preprocess the data, fit the KMeans model, and generate the clusters.
3. Check the output DataFrame (`lastdf`) for the cluster assignments.

## Files

- `book.csv`: The dataset containing book information.
- Jupyter notebook file containing the complete clustering code.

## Future Enhancements

- Fine-tune the number of clusters (`n_clusters`) for better categorization.
- Implement dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to visualize the clusters.
- Perform further exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
